How to Add Geocoder Functionality
=================================

What went wrong?
----------------

Geocoder.us was the geocoder used by GeoMOOSE by default and as of 30 June 2016 it was no longer working.
As an alternative, GeoMOOSE has always included an example Google Maps API Geocoder but it is encumbered
by Google useage licenses including the requirement of an API key.

What happens now?
-----------------

When a user attempts a geocode, GeoMOOSE will display an error::

	No Google API key has been defined. Please set in local_settings.ini.

How do I fix it?
----------------

1. Get a `Google Maps API Key <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key>`_.
2. In the ``conf/local_settings.ini`` file add a line that contains the new key from Google::

	google_api_key= ...


Please read the Google Maps API Terms of Service to ensure they are appropriate for your application!
