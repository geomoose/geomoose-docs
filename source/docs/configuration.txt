GeoMOOSE Configuration Options
==============================

Introduction
-------------
GeoMOOSE has a plethora of configuration options.  All of them can be changed in the mapbook and it is possible to highly customize the interface without writing a single line of code.  This document attempts to keep up with the various settings options in order to give the user more control over their GeoMOOSE installation.  Organization is arbitrarily alphabetisized (mostly).

How to Change a Setting
-----------------------
Every Mapbook has a <configuration> section.  In the <configuration> section there are multiple <param> fields.  The <param> fields are how settings are changed from their defaults.  For example, to add some HTML to the Links bar::

        <configuration>
                ...
                <param name="links_bar_html"><![CDATA[This is some html, with a <a href="http://www.google.com">link to Google!</a>]]></param>
                ...
        </configuration>
